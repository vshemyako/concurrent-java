 * Sub chapter 5.3<br>
 * Bounded queues are a powerful resource management tool for building reliable applications: they make your program
 * more robust to overload by throttling activities that threaten to produce more work than can be handled.<br>
 * Sub chapter 5.4<br>
 * The only situation when it is possible to ignore an interrupt is when you're controlling all of the code
 * higher up the stack.<br>
 * Sub chapter 5.5<br>
 * A synchronizer is any object that synchronizes the control flow of threads based on its state.<br>
 * <b>Latch</b> is a synchronizer that can delay progress of threads until it reaches its terminal state.<br>
 * <b>Semaphore</b> is a synchronizer that controls number of activities that can access the resource or perform a given
 * action at the same time.<br>
 * <b>Barrier</b> is a reusable synchronizer which blocks a group of threads until some event has occurred.<br>
